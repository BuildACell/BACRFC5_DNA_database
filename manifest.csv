Name,Description
amajLime,Measurement: AmajLime green chromoprotein under the T7 promoter.
cjBlue,Measurement: CjBlue blue chromoprotein under the T7 promoter.
eforRed,Measurement: EforRed red chromoprotein under the T7 promoter.
gfasPurple,Measurement: GfasPurple purple chromoprotein under the T7 promoter.
lacI,Measurement: LacI-M repressor under control of the T7 promoter
cjBlue-lacO,Measurement: Leaky expression control consisting of cjBlue under control of the pT7-lacO promoter. Failure of repression by lacI will appear as chromoprotein expression.
eforRed-lacO,Measurement: Leaky expression control consisting of eforRed under control of the pT7-lacO promoter. Failure of repression by lacI will appear as chromoprotein expression.
meleRFP,Measurement: MeleRFP red fluorescent protein under the T7 promoter.
mmilCFP,Measurement: MmilCFP blue fluorescent protein under the T7 promoter.
pT7-tetO-lacO,Measurement: PlamGFP green fluorescent protein dual-repressed by tetR and lacI.
pT7-lacO-tetO,Measurement: PlamGFP green fluorescent protein dual-repressed by tetR and lacI.
plamGFP-PURE,Measurement: PlamGFP green fluorescent protein optimized for cell-free expression in PURE.
plamGFP-TXTL,Measurement: PlamGFP green fluorescent protein optimized for cell-free expression in TXTL.
plamGFP-Chimeric,Measurement: PlamGFP green fluorescent protein with chimeric promoter for expression in PURE and TXTL.
pT7-lacO,Measurement: PlamGFP green fluorescent protein with repressed by the lac repressor lacI.
pT7-tetO,Measurement: PlamGFP green fluorescent protein with repressed by the tet repressor tetR.
cjBlue-lacO-His6,Measurement: Purification control consisting of cjBlue with lac-repression and a c-terminal 6xHis tag. Affinity purification of this protein should result in visible column capture and a visible eluent.
eforRed-lacO-His6,Measurement: Purification control consisting of eforRed with lac-repression and a c-terminal 6xHis tag. Affinity purification of this protein should result in visible column capture and a visible eluent.
tetR,Measurement: TetR repressor under control of the T7 promoter
RBS,MoClo: Elowitz reference E. coli ribosome binding site from Elowitz (1999).
pOpenv3-MCL0,MoClo: pOpenv3 MoClo destination vector for assembly of level 0 modules into a functional transcription unit.
